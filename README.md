# Multi-class-Segmentation-and-Classification-for-Skin-Disease

## About
The project demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in the analysis of histopathological images. We tackled various challenges that arise in this domain, such as the inherent variability in tissue appearance, the intricate structures within the tissues, the limited availability of labeled data, the large sizes of the images, and the potential discrepancies between different observers' interpretations. Our developed framework showcased remarkable capabilities in accurately segmenting and classifying histopathological images, although there is still room for further enhancement and refinement.
